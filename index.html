            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                Hello! I'm an AI researcher and full-stack developer who loves exploring how technology can think,
                learn, and create.
                I’m passionate about turning complex ideas into clear, purposeful systems. My interest spans from
                intelligent
                models to modern, efficient applications built on scalable AWS architectures.

            </p>
            <p>
                My philosophy: keep things simple, scalable, and human-centered.
                Outside of coding, I enjoy playing the piano, music composition, art, anime and games! It doesn't
                have to
                be about business, if you feel like it, don't be afraid to reach out to me!
            </p>

                            Challenge<span class="external-icon">↗</span></strong></a>, a challenge that tests
                    real-world cloud engineering
                    skills by combining front-end design, back-end development, and DevOps automation into a single
                    end-to-end
                    project.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The project serves as both a showcase of my skills and a hands-on demonstration of
                    <strong>modern cloud infrastructure design</strong> — from IaC automation and CI/CD pipelines to
                    scalable, globally distributed delivery with AWS CloudFront.

                <h2>Tech Stack Overview</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> Static site built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.</li>
                    <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Serverless compute using AWS Lambda and API Gateway for visitor
                        counter.</li>
                    <li><strong>Database:</strong> Amazon DynamoDB for fast, scalable data storage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Infrastructure:</strong> Provisioned via <strong>Terraform</strong> for reproducible IaC
                        deployments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hosting:</strong> AWS S3 (static hosting) + CloudFront (global CDN) + Route53 (DNS).
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>CI/CD:</strong> Automated builds and deployments through GitHub and CodePipeline.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The diagram above shows the core architecture of this website and its development environment.
                    Frontend assets are hosted on Amazon S3 and distributed globally through CloudFront,
                    while backend requests are processed through API Gateway and AWS Lambda functions connected to
                    DynamoDB.
                </p>


                <p>
                    The source code is version-controlled on GitHub and automatically deployed when changes are pushed.
                    This ensures a <strong>clean, reproducible workflow</strong> for maintaining and extending the site.
